# Not used in since 2023

These examples work with TensorFlow version 1 which was deprecated in Google Colab in summer of 2022.

This material has been superceded by the Edge Impulse example. 

If you would like to work through a similar example to get a feel for processing audio the [TensorFlow simple audio tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/audio/simple_audio) provides a good basis (note it does not implement on a microcontroller so you would need to make that extra step yourself based on week 4 learning).
