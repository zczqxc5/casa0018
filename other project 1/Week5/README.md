# Micro Speech CASA

Two sections in this folder:
    
- this root folder contains the prebuilt Arduino example (Ch7 TinyML book)
    
- ~~the training folder contains a second section with training notebook (Ch8 TinyML book)~~

- the Edge Impulse folder contains an example built using Edge Impulse 

Arduino example based on the TensorFlow [micro_speech](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/lite/micro/examples/micro_speech) example described in Ch.7 of TinyML book and in the "examples" folder of Arduino when the tensorflow lite library is installed.

Video below shows an example deployed on Arduino Nano.
